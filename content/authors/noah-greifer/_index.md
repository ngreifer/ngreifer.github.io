I'm Noah Greifer (pronounced *gree-fur*; *pronouns: [he/him](https://www.mypronouns.org/he-him)*), a statistical consultant and programmer at Harvard University. I provide statistical consulting services as a member of the Data Science Services team at the Institute for Quantitative Social Science (IQSS) at Harvard. I also develop R packages, both as part of my job and in my personal time. Some of these packages include `MatchIt`, `WeightIt`, and `cobalt`, which facilitate the use of propensity score methods. See my other packages at the [Software](/software) link above. I post on my [blog](/blog) about R programming, statistical analysis, and R package development.

I currently reside in Cambridge, MA, but I grew up in Los Angeles, CA, and have lived in San Diego, CA, Portland, OR, and Durham, NC.
