This page documents the software packages I have worked on. If you have any questions about them, please submit your question to their GitHub issues page rather than emailing me. You are also welcome to ask a question on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) or [CrossValidated](https://stats.stackexchange.com/), which I check often.

## R packages

These packages are ones that I am a primary author on and have expertise on the methods implemented. I consider these packages to be "mine", at least partly, in the sense that I can speak not only on the implementation but on the methods as well.

* `cobalt`: Covariate Balance Tables and Plots
  - Noah Greifer | [website](https://ngreifer.github.io/cobalt) | [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=cobalt) | [source](https://github.com/ngreifer/cobalt)
* `WeightIt`: Weighting for Covariate Balance in Observational Studies
  - Noah Greifer | [website](https://ngreifer.github.io/WeightIt) | [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=WeightIt) | [source](https://github.com/ngreifer/WeightIt)
* `MatchIt`: Nonparametric Preprocessing for Parametric Causal Inference

These packages are ones that I have developed as part of my job but which I don't consider "mine" in the sense that I am not the primary maintainer and I don't have expertise on the methods implemented. Please do not contact me about these packages.

* `netlit`: Augment a literature review with network analysis statistics
  - Devin Judge-Lord and Noah Greifer | [website](https://judgelord.github.io/netlit) | [source](https://github.com/judgelord/netlit)

* `EvoPhylo`: Pre- And Postprocessing of Morphological Data from Relaxed Clock Bayesian Phylogenetics
  - Tiago Sim√µes, Noah Greifer, and Stephanie Pierce | [website](https://tiago-simoes.github.io/EvoPhylo/) | [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=EvoPhylo) | [source](https://github.com/tiago-simoes/EvoPhylo)
  
* `Morphoscape`: Computation and Visualization of Adaptive Landscapes
  - Blake Dickson, Stephanie Pierce, and Noah Greifer | [website](https://blakedickson.github.io/Morphoscape/) | [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=Morphoscape) | [source](https://github.com/blakedickson/Morphoscape)
